# What we will do
  - Configure Ghost Stack
  - Create a Custom Network
  - Create a Project Directory
  - Create and Configure MySQL Container
  - Create and Configure Traefik Reverse Proxy
  - Create and Configure Ghost Container
  - Deploy Ghost with MySQL and Traefik
  - Testing

### Configure Ghost Stack

```sh
$ docker network ls
$ docker network create traefiknet
$ docker network ls
```
### Configure MySQL Service

Edit the 'docker-compose.yml' file and change the items that are between << >>
      
    ...
    MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: <<SET-ROOT-PASSWORD>>
    MYSQL_USER: <<SET-USER-MYSQL>>
    MYSQL_PASSWORD: <<SET-PASSWORD>>
    MYSQL_DATABASE: <<SET-DATABASE>>
    ...

### Configure Traefik Reverse Proxy

Still in docker-compose.yml, change the other itens that is between << >>

    ...
    - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:<<SET-TRAEFIK-HOSTNAME>>"
    ...
    - "traefik.frontend.rule=Host:<<SET-SITE-HOSTNAME>>"
    ...
    database__connection__user: <<SET-USER-MYSQL>>
    database__connection__password: <<SET-PASSWORD>>
    database__connection__database: <<SET-DATABASE>>
    ...
Before editing the 'docker-compose.yml' script, we need edit a traefik configuration named 'traefik.toml'. Change the itens that is between << >>

    ...
    "<<USERNAME:PASSWORD>>", # generate this with htpasswd -nb user password        
    ...
    domain = "<<DOMAIN>>"
    ...
    email = "<<CHANGE-TO-USERNAME-IN-LETSENCRYPT>>"
    ...
Create the blank 'acme.json' file and change the permission to 600.

    touch acme.json
    chmod 600 acme.json 

### Deploy Ghost with MySQL and Traefik

    docker-compose up -d

If you have an error, check the container log using commands below.

    docker-compose logs mysql
    docker-compose logs traefik
    docker-compose logs ghost

### Testing

Open the Traefik dashboard with its URL, mine is http://<<TRAEFIK-HOSTNAME>>/. Log in with the user and password on the 'traefik.toml' file, and following is the Traefik dashboard.
